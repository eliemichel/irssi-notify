# Irssi-Notify #

Notifications for the IRC client [Irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) *via* a simple http server.

We use a http server for the notfication system to work over an ssh connexion for exemple (cf *Usage* section).

The system is divided into two parts : the script for Irssi which fires http requests and the server that handle them and call a given command.

Two versions of the server are available. The first one uses [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and the second one is made with Python 3.

The command called by default is `notify-send` but it can easily be replaced by changing the value of `NOTIF_COMMAND` in server.py or notify-serv.js.


## Usage ##

For both servers the begining is the same :

1. Put notify.pl in `~/.irssi/scripts`
2. Type `/script load notify` in Irssi

Then you have to choose the server system you prefere :

### With Nodejs

1. Install required node packages with `npm install`
2. Start the notify server : `./notify-server.js` or `node notify-server.js`


### With Python

1. Run `./server.py` or `python3 server.py`

**Note**: If you can't run the server (`./notify-server.js : command not found` or `./server.py : command not found`), try to make the file executable with `chmod +x notify-server.js` or `chmod +x server.py` respectively.


### Over SSH

If you use Irssi over ssh, you just have to forward port 9871 when you connect
to ssh, like this :

    ssh user@host -R 9871:localhost:9871



## Customization ##

If you want use your own script to handle notifications instead of the default
`notify-send`, just replace it in notify-server.js or server.py.

You can for example use the `beep` command to repalce visual notifications by a sound.

You can also change the format of the notifications in the notify.pl irssi script. (For example to translate it from Frenchâ€¦)
